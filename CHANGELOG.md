		*  Use exception instead of `null` for data retrival (this seems to be more natural in Java)

	* Add `AirplaneModeOperationPlugin` to toggle the airplane mode (root only)
	* Add `SendSmsOperationPlugin` to send SMS
	* Add `SmsEventPlugin` to listen to incoming SMSs

* v0.4.4: Introduce `SynchronizationOperationPlugin` and `NetworkTransmissionOperationPlugin` && Add *root features* && Bug fixes && Deveopment changes
	* Introduce `SynchronizationOperationPlugin` to control the *account synchronization* setting
	* Introduce `NetworkTransmissionOperationPlugin` to send network packets
	* Introduce the ability to use rooted-only features
		* Some functions don't have exposed APIs so using reflections is the way to implement them previously. However such reflection is not guaranteed to work on all devices so these functions are not reliable. Using root permission could help to solve (at least part of) this problem by using root-only actions (e.g. executing special commands).
		* Add a section in the settings page to control the enabling state
		* Introduce a way to mark each plugin's needs of using root permission (to use in the future)
		* Adopt rooted features to `CellularOperationPlugin` (to turn mobile data on and off)
	* Fix the `equals()` method in some data (this bug has no affection of daily usage)

		* Serializing always yields the newest version of data format
		* The old interface is deprecated and will be completely removed in the future
	* Add JSON as a backend (co-exists with XML)
		* JSON is now preferred and used by default
		* Compatibility to old data (XML format) is kept
			* When saving (editing) from a old data, it will be stored to JSON format
		* The old XML backend exists and there isn't a current plan to remove it
	* Handling (saving, editing, listing) of events and profiles should be faster now
	* Large refactoring (e.g. generify lots of classes) related to the data storage backend

* v0.4.2.1: UI improvements
	* Better UI of the page for editing events

		* remove the need of `EventData.pluginClass()`
		* remove the need of static method `OerationPlugin.pname()` and `EventPlugin.pname()` in the implementation of event plugins (not in the interface)
	* Rename `ryey.easer.core.ui.edit.PluginViewFragment` to `ryey.easer.core.ui.edit.PluginViewContainerFragment` to avoid name duplication with `skills.PluginViewFragment` (which was introduced in v0.4)
	* More tests
